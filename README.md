### Counter

This test implements a basic counter component that allows the user to increment and decrement a counter value using buttons. The counter value is stored in the Redux store and is updated using Redux actions.

### Show/Hide Text from Store

This test demonstrates how to show and hide text based on a value stored in the Redux store. The text is displayed or hidden based on a button click that triggers a Redux action to update the store value.

### Add/Delete Workers from Store

This test implements a list of workers stored in the Redux store as an array of objects. The user can add or delete workers from the list using buttons that trigger Redux actions.

### Translator App to Show Text Depending on the Selected Language

This test implements a translator app that displays text in different languages based on the selected language. The language selection is stored in the Redux store and the text is updated using Redux actions.

## Conclusion

These tests demonstrate some of the basic functionality of React and Redux. They can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications using these technologies.
